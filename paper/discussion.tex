\subsection{Mitigation}
We now discuss ways to mitigate the issues our work raised.  We distinguish
between short-term solutions that could be implemented quickly
(\S~\ref{sec:short-term}), and long-term solution that need significantly more
work (\S~\ref{sec:long-term}).

\subsubsection{Short-term solutions}
\label{sec:short-term}
Exit relays seem stuck in a predicament, having to choose between running their
own resolver (which exposes DNS queries to network adversaries) and using a
third-party resolver (which exposes DNS queries to a third party).  If we were
given the choice to reconfigure the DNS setup of all exit relays, what would we
do?  Clearly, the goal is to minimize exposure of DNS requests, but there are
several dimensions to this.  Ignoring substantial DNS protocol improvements for
now, we can envision three extreme scenarios, in which \emph{all} exit relays
use either \first Google's DNS resolver; \second their own, local resolver; or
\third the resolver provided by their ISP.  If all exit relays would use Google,
the company would obtain metadata about the activity of all Tor users---a clear
violation of Tor's design goal of distributing trust.  This scenario is clearly
to avoid.\footnote{To make matters worse, Fifield et al.'s~\cite{Fifield2015a}
censorship circumvention system meek leverages Google's cloud infrastructure
to reach the Tor network.  Inevitably, many of the thousands of meek clients
will select exit relays that use Google's DNS resolver, which means that Google
gets to see both traffic entering \emph{and}, partially, exiting the Tor
network.} Next, let us imagine a Tor network that only uses local resolvers.  In
that case, Tor is fully independent of third-party resolvers, but at the cost of
the DNS resolution process being exposed to the network, allowing several
parties to learn what domains Tor users are looking up.  Finally, all exit
relays could simply use their ISP-provided resolver.  This would minimize the
network exposure of DNS requests as resolvers are frequently in the same AS as
exit relays, and network-level adversaries would be unable to distinguish
between DNS requests from exit relays and unrelated ISP customers.  This setup,
however, comes at the cost of potentially misconfigured and censored DNS
resolvers~\cite[\S~4.1]{Winter2014b}.  Besides, just a few ASs---OVH, for
example---host a disproportionate amount of exit relays, turning them into the
very centralized data trough we seek to avoid.  Table~\ref{tab:setup-comparison}
recapitulates the key aspects of all three setups.  Considering the above, we
believe that exit relay operators should avoid public resolvers such as Google
and OpenDNS.  Instead, they should either use the resolvers provided by their
ISP, or run their own---in particular, if their ISP already hosts many other
exit relays.  Local resolvers can further be optimized to minimize information
leakage, e.g., by configuring QNAME minimization~\cite{qname-minimization}.

\end{table}

Besides making recommendations to exit relay operators, we can remotely
influence the cache of each exit relay's resolver.  For example, using exitmap,
we can resolve the domain sensitive.org over each exit relay continuously, right
before its TTL is about to expire.  That way, once a Tor user connects to
sensitive.org, the exit relay can serve the DNS request from its cache instead
of exposing it to third parties.  Clearly, this approach does not scale, but it
allows us to eliminate DNS-based correlation attacks for a select number of
sites.

\subsubsection{Long-term solutions}
\label{sec:long-term}
Practical defenses are on the horizon.  Zhu et al.~\cite{Zhu2015a} proposed
T-DNS, which employs a number of TCP optimizations to transport the DNS protocol
over TLS and TCP.  Since T-DNS is based on TCP, it can be readily sent over Tor.
The TLS layer provides confidentiality between exit relays and their resolvers.
Finally, site operators whose users are particularly concerned about their
safety should offer an onion service as an alternative.  Facebook, for example,
set up \url{facebookcorewwwi.onion} as an alternative front-end.  When
connecting to the onion service, Tor users never leave the Tor network, and
hence no not need DNS.
