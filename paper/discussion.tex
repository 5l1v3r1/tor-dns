\subsection{Mitigation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What do we recommend to exit relay operators to mitigate the issue?
	\item Is it better to run your own, local resolver?
	\item Or should you use your provider's resolver?
	\item \ldots or something else?
	\item Would qname minimisation help?
	\item Ideally, use only onion services, or perhaps OnionNS, or the GNU Name
		System~\cite{Wachs2014a}.
	\item Can exit relays use private information retrieval to fetch domain
		names anonymously?
	\item Is there a trade-off between enforced min DNS TTL and the impact of
		DNS poisoning?
	\item A tool that forces Tor-exits to regularly resolve uniquely identifying
		domain names?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ethics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IRB approval for DNS statistics.
	\item Consulted with ethics review board and Tor developers.
\end{itemize}
