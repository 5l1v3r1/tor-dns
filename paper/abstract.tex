\begin{abstract}
Many research projects investigated end-to-end correlation attacks on the Tor
network.  However, all this work was limited to the TCP flow between client and
server.  The accompanying DNS traffic was ignored.
%
In this work, we analyze the impact of DNS for correlation attacks.  We
(\emph{i}) enumerate what DNS resolvers exit relays use, we (\emph{ii}) quantify
the additional exposure of DNS requests to network-level adversaries, and we
(\emph{iii}) investigate how DNS requests can be combined with Web site
fingerprinting attacks to deanonymize Tor connections.
%
Our results show that Google's DNS server observes around 25\% of DNS requests
exiting the Tor network.  Also, on average DNS requests traverse $X$ times more
autonomous systems than end-to-end TCP flows.
