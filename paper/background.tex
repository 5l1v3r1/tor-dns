\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
We now give a brief introduction to website fingerprinting and DNS resolution
over the Tor network.

\paragraph{Website fingerprinting attacks}
The Tor network encrypts relayed traffic as it travels from the client to the
exit relay.  Therefore, intermediate parties such as the user's Internet service
provider (ISP) are not able to read any packet content.  However, Tor does not
protect meta information such as packet inter-arrival timing, frequency, and
length.  Exploiting these properties, the ISP can use a classifier to guess what
sites the user is visiting.  The literature calls this attack \emph{website
fingerprinting}.  Past work evaluated website fingerprinting (WF) attacks in
either a closed work or an open world setting.
A closed world setting consists of a set
of $n$ \emph{monitored} websites, and the attackers tries to learn which among
all $n$ sites the user is visiting with the notable restriction that the user
can only browse to one of the $n$ websites.

The open world setting is more realistic: the user can browse to
\emph{unmonitored} sites in addition to the monitored sites. Unmonitored sites
are, per definition, not known the attacker and consequently the attacker's
classifier cannot train on unmonitored sites the user visits. Note that the
attacker classifier can train on whatever number of unmonitored sites it wants,
as long as during testing of the classifier the classifier has not trained on
an unmonitored site being tested. Two relevant metrics for WF attacks in the
open-world setting are recall and precision.
Recall measures the probability that a visit to a monitored
page will be detected, while precision measures the probability
that a classification by the classifier of a visit to a monitored
site (positive test outcome) is the correct one. Consider a classifier with
0.25 recall and 0.5 precision: on average, every fourth visit by the user to
a monitored site will be detected, and half of the classifications by the
classifier will be wrong. Often, when a classifier is wrong,
it is due to either classifying a monitored site as unmonitored or vice versa.
Mistaking one monitored site for another is less likely.

Tor---and any other anonymity network---could eliminate WF
attacks by employing encrypted, constant-rate channels between a Tor client and
its guard.  Unfortunately, the Tor network's limited spare capacity does not
allow for such an expensive defense, but some research has worked on making it
more efficient~\cite{Cai2014a,DBLP:journals/corr/JuarezIPDW15,WangThesis}.

\paragraph{The Tor network}
The Tor network is an overlay network that anonymizes TCP streams such as web
traffic.  As of April 2016, it counts approximately 7,000 relays and about two
million users.  Clients send data over the Tor network by randomly selecting
three relays---typically called the guard, middle, and exit relay---that then
form a virtual tunnel called a \emph{circuit}.  The guard relay learns the
client's IP address, but not its web activity, while the exit relay gets to
learn the client's web activity, but not its IP address.  Relays and clients
talk to each other using the Tor protocol, which uses 512-byte \emph{cells}.
Finally, each relay is uniquely identified by its \emph{fingerprint}, a hash
function over its public key.

\paragraph{How Tor handles DNS}
Tor clients must send DNS requests over Tor to prevent DNS leakage, \ie, have a
DNS request escape its encrypted connection.  Tor does not transport UDP
traffic, but it implements a workaround to wrap DNS requests into Tor cells.
After the user types in a domain, say foo.com, Tor Browser establishes a
connection to the SOCKS proxy exposed by the local Tor client.  Using the SOCKS
protocol, applications instruct the Tor client to establish a circuit to a given
domain and port.\footnote{SOCKS in version 4a and 5 supports connection
initiations using domain names in addition to IP addresses.} The Tor client then
selects an exit relay whose exit policy supports foo.com and port 443.  Next,
the client sends a \texttt{RELAY\_BEGIN} Tor cell to the exit relay, instructing
it to first resolve foo.com, and then establish a TCP connection to the resolved
address at port 443~\cite[\S~6.2]{tor-spec}.  After successfully establishing a
connection, the exit relay responds with a \texttt{RELAY\_CONNECTED} cell to the
local Tor client.  Subsequently, data can be exchanged with the intended
destination.  The \texttt{RELAY\_RESOLVE} cell supports pure name resolution,
without establishing a subsequent TCP connection~\cite[\S~6.4]{tor-spec}.  The
exit relay responds with a \texttt{RELAY\_RESOLVED} cell.

As of December 2015, both exit relays and Tor clients maintain a caching layer
around the DNS resolution code to speed up repeated lookups.  Exit relays send
their DNS requests to the system resolver, which Linux systems read from
\texttt{/etc/resolv.conf}.  The system resolver is not modified by Tor, and
contains whatever the exit relay operator configured, e.g., the ISP's resolver,
or public resolvers such as Google's 8.8.8.8.
