\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

We focus on related work that covers low-latency anonymity networks.

Serjantov and Sewell discussed packet counting attacks for low-latency networks
in 2003~\cite{Serjantov2003a}.  They focused on single nodes in an anonymity
network and conjectured that their technique is harder to apply to an anonymity
network.

In 2004, Feamster and Dingledine~\cite{Feamster2004a} investigated Tor's and
Mixmaster's topological diversity against an adversary that controls an
autonomous system.  The authors found that tier-1 ISPs and path asymmetry reduce
are among the major issues, reducing location diversity.  Tor's current
safeguard to select relays in disjoint /16 networks is not sufficient to defend
against large autonomous systems.
