\subsection{Path inflation caused by DNS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many more ASes do we traverse when we consider DNS requests in
		addition to TCP connections?
	\item Demonstrate ``path inflation'' by tracerouting to most popular web
		sites that are accessed over Tor (see \S~\ref{sec:dns-root-dataset}).
	\item Reverse path might inflate AS coverage even more, but hard to measure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feasability of DNS request linking}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How hard is it for a passive adversary that sees both ends to link DNS
		requests?
\end{itemize}
